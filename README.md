# BANK LOAN PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

## I. PROJECT OVERVIEW: 
A fictitous bank aims to enhance its loan portfolio by identifying and focusing on productive loans that contribute positively to its revenue. Despite offering various loan products, the bank faces challenges in distinguishing high-performing loans from those that are unproductive, leading to increased default rates and reduced profitability.

## II. BUSINESS GOAL:
The goal is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of loan performance using key metrics and reports to optimize the bank’s lending strategy, minimize risk, and improve overall business outcomes.
 
## III. DATA AVAILABLE:
Loan ID, Purpose, Address State, Employee Length, Employee Title, Grade, Sub Grade, profiles, Home Ownership, Issue Date, Last Credit Pull Date, Last Payment Date, Loan Status, Next Payment Date, Purpose, Term, Verification Status, Annual Income, DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio), Instalment, Interest Rate, Loan Amount
 
## IV. ACTION: 
 Used MySQL (SQL) for database queries and database management and carefully analyzed the following parameters: 
 - KPIs 
 - Good Loan V/S Bad Loan (Productive vs Unproductive loan) analysis on various grounds.
 - Month-wise report 
 - State-wise report 
 - Overall report 
 - Report based on home ownership

V. Business Impact:
 - The analysis revealed significant negative impacts from bad loans (unproductive) , particularly in relation to borrowers' home ownership status (e.g., owning versus renting).
 - It also identified the states where the majority of the customer base resides and assessed their net contribution to the bank’s overall business.
